# Repentance

## Parable of the Mud

Imagine there’s a huge field of mud, and the Master asks that everyone crosses the mud, from one side to the other, along unique balance beams. These balance beams were straight and at several points, very narrow. And everyone’s looked a little different from the other balance beams.

At the beginning of the journey, the Master taught us to stay on the balance beam and that no unclean person would “enter” on the other side. The Master said He cannot look upon mud with the least degree of allowance. But He alone would be the only one to NEVER touch the mud. He taught that He Himself is the only one to wash clean anyone who had fallen in the mud. And finally He said, “what matters most is that you all come unto me to be cleaned of any mud.”

As we get started, some of us noticed signs in the mud that said:
- What ACTUALLY matters most is to NEVER fall in the mud in the first place.
- You’re a bad person if you touch the mud, because your only value is in NEVER touching the mud.

Then you are filled with hope and off you go! Then suddenly, your balance beam gets narrow and you take your eyes off of the course for just a moment and you fall all the way in the mud. The voice in your head says, “how could you! You knew you were never supposed to touch it! How could you be so foolish to fail your mission? Your recycled version is never going to be as valuable as the original, mud-free version, a version that you can never get back.”

Brothers and sisters, how quickly we forget that the focus of this difficult journey is about *becoming clean*, again and again and again if necessary. Instead, we believe the lies that Satan tells us—any mud ruins us, any mud has made us fail, or mud makes you a bad person. Well, if you give up and stay in the mud, then yes that is failure. But if you turn to the Lord, get cleaned off, you are exactly where you need to be, and I might add even better off.

I testify that the Lord uses our mistakes and weakness to teach us, strengthen us, and prepare us for more difficult times ahead. As I give my talk today, I invite you to put yourself in this parable of the mud and learn how to get cleaned off and back on track.

## Weakness vs Rebellion

First, I want to make an important distinction between the words weakness and rebellion.

Richard G. Scott in the October 2013 General Conference taught:
> “The joyful news for anyone who desires to be rid of the consequences of past poor choices is that the Lord sees weaknesses differently than He does rebellion. Whereas the Lord warns that unrepented rebellion will bring punishment, when the Lord speaks of weaknesses, it is always with mercy.”

### Scriptures related to Rebellion

In the scriptures we may read harsh words like “cut off” or “destroyed” and they may make us fear a mean God, however, these words are associated with actions like “fight against the lamb” or “rebel against God”:


| Reference    | Verse                                                                                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mosiah 15:26**       | But behold, and fear, and tremble before God, for ye ought to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth none such that *rebel against him and die in their sins*; yea, even all those that have perished in their sins ever since the world began, that have *willfully rebelled against God*, that have known the commandments of God, and would not keep them; these are they that have no part in the first resurrection. |
| **1 Nephi 2:20-24**    | Inasmuch as thy brethren shall *rebel against thee*, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.         |
| **1 Nephi 14:3-6**     | "the great pit which has been digged for the destruction of men... this is according to the captivity of the devil, and... the justice of God, upon all those who will work wickedness and abomination before him... if it so be they *harden their hearts against the Lamb of God*." |
| **Alma 9:24**          | For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will *rebel against him* that ye shall utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth? |


### Scriptures related to Weakness

In contrast, listen to how the Lord speaks about weakness:

| Reference    | Verse                                                                                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1 Nephi 1:14**       | "and thy power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!" |
| **1 Nephi 10:10**      | "He, who should take away the sins of the world"                                                               |
| **1 Nephi 11:31**      | "I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men… who were sick and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God. And the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out" |
| **Alma 7:12**          | And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities. |
| **3 Nephi 10:4-6**     | O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you. And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not. O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart. |
| **3 Nephi 9:22**       | Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved. |


I testify that because of our efforts to believe in Him, even mustard seeds of effort, He WANTS to cleanse us from our mistakes, He WANTS us to keep trying.

## Worthiness Is Not Flawlessness – Brad Wilcox (Oct. 2021)

In the October 2021 General Conference, Brad Wilcox said:

>Some mistakenly receive the message that repentance is a one-time event. God’s message is that, as President Russell M. Nelson has taught, “Repentance … is a process.” Repentance may take time and repeated effort, so forsaking sin and having “no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” are lifetime pursuits.

>Some mistakenly receive the message that they are not worthy to participate fully in the gospel because they are not completely free of bad habits. God’s message is that worthiness is not flawlessness. Worthiness is being honest and trying. We must be honest with God, priesthood leaders, and others who love us, and we must strive to keep God’s commandments and never give up just because we slip up.

## We Can Do Better and Be Better – President Nelson (April 2019)

So what is REPENTANCE? President Nelson defines it this way:

>The word for repentance in the Greek New Testament is *metanoeo*. The prefix *meta-* means “change.” The suffix *-noeo* is related to Greek words that mean “mind,” “knowledge,” “spirit,” and “breath.”

>Thus, when Jesus asks you and me to “repent,” He is inviting us to change our mind, our knowledge, our spirit—even the way we breathe. He is asking us to change the way we love, think, serve, spend our time, treat our wives, teach our children, and even care for our bodies.

>Nothing is more liberating, more ennobling, or more crucial to our individual progression than is a regular, daily focus on repentance. Repentance is not an event; it is a process. It is the key to happiness and peace of mind. When coupled with faith, repentance opens our access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

>Whether you are diligently moving along the covenant path, have slipped or stepped from the covenant path, or can’t even see the path from where you are now, I plead with you to repent. Experience the strengthening power of daily repentance—of doing and being a little better each day.

## What does it mean to be WORTHY?

Brad Wilcox says it means to be “honest and trying”

Merriam-Webster defines worthy as having worth, value, honor, based off merit or measure (estimable).

So what builds our value before God, and our worth? Great feats of faith and righteousness? Maybe, but if that were true, then I think we would have never heard from scripture heroes like Alma the Younger, Ammon, Aaron, King Lamoni, Saul of the New Testament, Joseph Smith, or the Anti-Nephi-Lehis, they wouldn’t have ever seen any miracles—their sins would have made them of little worth to God. I believe our *worth* and *value* before God is eternally high, nothing we can do will disqualify us from His love. Believe this Brothers and Sisters, that the Lord *loves* you.

### Commitment, Willingness, Resolve

Differently, our honor, or worthiness, is based upon an honest effort—a commitment, a *willingness*, a resolve—to obey the Lord’s commandments to follow Him! That honest commitment may take time (like Amulek<sup>1</sup>), or it might happen immediately like Alma the Younger<sup>2</sup>. (Mosiah 27:23-25). 

Imagine the hero that the people would have lost had Alma’s bishop said, “well thanks for coming and talking to me, but you’re gonna need some time before you can take the sacrament again”! (Mosiah 27:32 – And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people; 28:4 – for they were the vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw in His infinite mercy to spare them.)

The sons of Mosiah gained a testimony of Christ as their Redeemer. Being born again was perhaps the key to their worthiness.

### Clean

One other potential definition of the word worthy… clean? Clean to enter the temple, clean to partake of the sacrament. What does it mean to be clean?

The church website teaches on the sacrament: In partaking of the sacrament and making these commitments, Church members renew the covenant they made at baptism (see Mosiah 18:8–10; Doctrine and Covenants 20:37). In return, the Lord renews the promised remission of sin and enables Church members to “always have his Spirit to be with them.”

**REMISSION** is defined as a release from guilt or penalty, to restore to former status, to remove force or intensity.

- **Alma 12:34** - Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a *remission of his sins*; and these shall enter into my rest.
- **Alma 38:8** - And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a *remission of my sins*. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.
- **3 Nephi 7:16** – Nephi went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and *remission of sins* through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ. (25 - that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a *remission of their sins*.)
- **Moroni 8:25** – and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth *remission of sins*;

## You are HERE, I really don’t think your sins are Rebellion

The story of the Sons of Mosiah was Rebellion to Righteousness. That may not be the story for the rest of us, perhaps our story looks like somewhat righteousness to weakness to more righteousness.

For us, it’s the *willingness*, the *commitment*, the *resolve* to turn back to Him, to follow Him, to obey Him. It’s as soon as we decide “The sin is over, I’m done with that life, I’m back on the path to the Savior”—He will be at our side immediately.

I wonder if we really knew how much the Savior loved to give us remission of sins… I guess he’d try to do it every week.

## Look to God and Live

Instead of looking down in shame, or to the side for excuses. Let us look UP to GOD for comfort, for hope, for strength, and for mercy.

When we find ourselves in the mud… again. May we not spend any time looking down and hating ourselves. Please look up and be clean!

**Alma 33:19-22** – O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?

May we take the next step and get out of the mud. In fact, what is the MOST important step we can take in our journey? Is it the last step in our journey? Is it the first step of the journey? Was it the step that we just took—the one that got us here? I believe the most important step we can take, is the next step<sup>3</sup>. 

No matter what has happened in our pasts… whether it was years ago, last week, or last night, I invite each of us to re-turn toward the Savior and let him heal you<sup>4</sup>.
