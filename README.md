This project contains various efforts to augment gospel study.

The sermons folder contains drafts of my own general conference quality discourses on topics that are meaningful to me, starting with my talk on repentance given in Springville, Jan 2024.

The scriptures_db folder contains code to analyze the scriptures using various practices of computational literary analysis.
