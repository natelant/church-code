# Title

I was asked to speak on the recent conference talk from 
Sister Dennis, "Put Ye On the Lord Jesus Christ". One quote 
stuck out to me that says:

> [Our Prophet] has spoken repeatedly about covenants for years and especially since becoming President of the Church. Learn from his teachings about the beautiful blessings and increased power and capacity that can be yours through making and keeping covenants with God. - Sister J. Anette Dennis (April 2024)

## Deep Dive

So I decided to take a deep dive into the talks she referenced 
from our Prophet, President Russell M. Nelson. In just 5 talks, 
he mentioned 49 promises to those who keep their covenenants, 
and he mentioned a couple of things that we can do to obtain these promises.
In my talk today, I want to discuss what he is asking us to do, and what
promises we can obtain.

## Expectations

So how do we draw upon this power? Well President Nelson said

> This process is neither quick nor easy, but it is spiritually invigorating. (Spiritual Treasures, Nov 2019)

> It takes persistent rigorous spiritual work... It takes consistent daily effort (Let God Previal, Oct 2020)

> Overcoming the world is not an event that happens in a day or two. It happens over a lifetime as we repeatedly embrace the doctrine of Christ. (Overcome the World and Find Rest, Oct 2022)

### Quick and Easy vs Consistent and Rigorous

| Quick and Easy                     | Consistent and Rigorous                |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Door Dash and fast food (Cafe Rio)  | Planting a garden  |
| Amazon                             | Saving money, building a business |
| Entertainment - Netflix, Spotify   | Physical strength - Olympians, sports, music  |
| Information - Google, Siri, ChatGPT  | Learning a language         |
| Amazon                             | Strong relationships  |

| Amazon                             | Testimony and conversion                |


## Serve Others

> My dear sisters, your power will increase as you serve others. - President Russell M. Nelson (Spiritual Treasures, Nov 2019)

Service... what do you think of? Do you think of sacrifice? 
Does the word sacrifice make you think of sacrament?
Does the word sacrament make you think of covenants?

Sacrifice and sacrament come from the same Latin root *sacer* meaning *holy*. 

## Overcome the World and Let God Prevail

> Before the Savior submitted Himself to the agony of Gethsemane and Calvary, He declared to His Apostles, “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”3 Subsequently, Jesus entreated each of us to do the same when He said, “I will that ye should overcome the world.” (Overcome the World and Find Rest, Oct 2022)

> How, then, do we overcome the world? King Benjamin taught us how. He said that “the natural man is an enemy to God” and remains so forever “unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord.” (Overcome the World and Find Rest, Oct 2022)

> Part of this endeavor will require you to put aside many things of this world. Sometimes we speak almost casually about walking away from the world with its contention, pervasive temptations, and false philosophies. But truly doing so requires you to examine your life meticulously and regularly. As you do so, the Holy Ghost will prompt you about what is no longer needful, what is no longer worthy of your time and energy. As you shift your focus away from worldly distractions, some things that seem important to you now will recede in priority. You will need to say no to some things, even though they may seem harmless. As you embark upon and continue this lifelong process of consecrating your life to the Lord, the changes in your perspective, feelings, and spiritual strength will amaze you! - President Russell M. Nelson (Spiritual Treasures, Nov 2019)

> Are you willing to let God prevail in your life? Are you willing to let God be the most important influence in your life? Will you allow His words, His commandments, and His covenants to influence what you do each day? Will you allow His voice to take priority over any other? Are you willing to let whatever He needs you to do take precedence over every other ambition? Are you willing to have your will swallowed up in His? - President Russell M. Nelson (Let God Prevail, Oct 2020)

> Now, overcoming the world certainly does not mean becoming perfect in this life, nor does it mean that your problems will magically evaporate—because they won’t. And it does not mean that you won’t still make mistakes. But overcoming the world does mean that your resistance to sin will increase. Your heart will soften as your faith in Jesus Christ increases.8 Overcoming the world means growing to love God and His Beloved Son more than you love anyone or anything else. (Overcome the World and Find Rest, Oct 2022)

The Lord is not requiring us to give up everything. 
But there are times when He does ask a lot of us.
Think of the young man in the new testament who was asked
to sell everything he has and to follow the Savior (). 
What does that mean?
Sometimes it means we need to give up **power, possessions, popularity, and pleasures** 
of this world. Think about these words

- Power
- Possessions
- Popularity
- Pleasures - this one I could talk about all day...

## Worship in the Temple

> The temple lies at the center of strengthening our faith and spiritual fortitude because the Savior and His doctrine are the very heart of the temple. Everything taught in the temple, through instruction and through the Spirit, increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. His essential ordinances bind us to Him through sacred priesthood covenants. Then, as we keep our covenants, He endows us with His healing, strengthening power.3 And oh, how we will need His power in the days ahead. - President Russell M. Nelson (The Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation, Oct 2021)

> Everything we believe and every promise God has made to His covenant people come together in the temple. (The Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation, Oct 2021)

> If you don’t yet love to attend the temple, go more often—not less. Let the Lord, through His Spirit, teach and inspire you there. I promise you that over time, the temple will become a place of safety, solace, and revelation. (The Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation, Oct 2021)
