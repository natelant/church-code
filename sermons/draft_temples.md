# President Nelson: Temples

## Now Is the Time – April 2022
Positive spiritual momentum increases as we worship in the temple and grow
in our understanding of the magnificent breadth and depth of the blessings we
receive there. I plead with you to counter worldly ways by focusing on the
eternal blessings of the temple. Your time there brings blessings for eternity.

## Make Time for the Lord – October 2021
As I emphasized this morning, please make time for the Lord in His holy
house. Nothing will strengthen your spiritual foundation like temple service
and temple worship.

## The Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation – October 2021
The temple lies at the center of strengthening our faith and spiritual fortitude
because the Savior and His doctrine are the very heart of the temple.
Everything taught in the temple, through instruction and through the Spirit,
increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. His essential ordinances bind us
to Him through sacred priesthood covenants. Then, as we keep our
covenants, He endows us with His healing, strengthening power. 3  And oh,
how we will need His power in the days ahead.
Everything we believe and every promise God has made to His covenant
people come together in the temple. In every age, the temple has
underscored the precious truth that those who make covenants with God and
keep them are children of the covenant.
He is the One who wants you to understand with great clarity exactly what you
are making covenants to do. He is the One who wants you to experience
fully His sacred ordinances. He wants you to comprehend your privileges,
promises, and responsibilities. He wants you to have spiritual insights and
awakenings you’ve never had before. This He desires for all temple patrons,
no matter where they live.
He is providing opportunities for each of us to bolster our spiritual foundations
more effectively by centering our lives on Him and on the ordinances and
covenants of His temple. When you bring your temple recommend, a contrite
heart, and a seeking mind to the Lord’s house of learning, He will teach you.

Should distance, health challenges, or other constraints prohibit your temple
attendance for a season, I invite you to set a regular time to rehearse in your
mind the covenants you have made.
As you marry in the temple and return repeatedly, you will be strengthened
and guided in your decisions.
Begin now to learn and experience what it means to be armed with priesthood
power.
And to each of you who has made temple covenants, I plead with you to
seek—prayerfully and consistently—to understand temple covenants and
ordinances. Spiritual doors will open. You will learn how to part the veil
between heaven and earth, how to ask for God’s angels to attend you, and
how better to receive direction from heaven. Your diligent efforts to do so will
reinforce and strengthen your spiritual foundation.

## COVID-19 and Temples – October 2021
I pray that your desire to worship and serve in the temple burns more brightly
now than ever.
We want to bring the house of the Lord even closer to our members, that they
may have the sacred privilege of attending the temple as often as their
circumstances allow.
Temples are a vital part of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its
fulness. Ordinances of the temple fill our lives with power and strength
available in no other way. We thank God for those blessings.

## What We Are Learning and Will Never Forget – April 2021
Often when the Lord warns us about the perils of the last days, He counsels
thus: “Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved.” 2  These “holy places”
certainly include the Lord’s temples and meetinghouses.
Take time to immerse yourself in the scriptures and worship in the temple.

## A New Normal – October 2020
Embrace your new normal by repenting daily. Seek to be increasingly pure in
thought, word, and deed. Minister to others. Keep an eternal perspective.
Magnify your callings. And whatever your challenges, my dear brothers and
sisters, live each day so that you are more prepared to meet your Maker. 4
That is why we have temples. The Lord’s ordinances and covenants prepare
us for eternal life, the greatest of all of God’s blessings.
As we build and maintain these temples, we pray that each of you will build
and maintain yourself so you can be worthy to enter the holy temple.

## Embrace the Future with Faith – October 2020
The temple—the house of the Lord—is a place of security unlike any other.

## Go Forward in Faith – April 2020
Brothers and sisters, during times of our distress when temples are closed,
you can still draw upon the power of your temple covenants and endowment
as you honor your covenants. Please use this time when temples are closed
to continue to live a temple-worthy life or to become temple worthy.

## Hear Him – April 2020
We can also hear Him in the temple. The house of the Lord is a house of
learning. There the Lord teaches in His own way. There each ordinance
teaches about the Savior. There we learn how to part the veil and
communicate more clearly with heaven. There we learn how to rebuke the
adversary and draw upon the Lord’s priesthood power to strengthen us and
those we love. How eager each of us should be to seek refuge there.
When these temporary COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, please schedule
regular time to worship and serve in the temple. Every minute of that time will
bless you and your family in ways nothing else can. Take time to ponder what
you hear and feel when you are there. Ask the Lord to teach you how to open
the heavens to bless your life and the lives of those you love and serve.
While worshipping in the temple is presently not possible, I invite you to
increase your participation in family history, including family history research
and indexing. I promise that as you increase your time in temple and family
history work, you will increase and improve your ability to hear Him.

## Closing Remarks – October 2019
But before they can enter a dedicated temple, they need to qualify. The Lord
wants all His children to partake of the eternal blessings available in His
temple. He has directed what each person must do to qualify to enter His holy
house.
Some of those questions have recently been edited for clarity. I would like to
review them for you now:
1. Do you have faith in and a testimony of God, the Eternal Father; His
Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost?
2. Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and of His
role as your Savior and Redeemer?
3. Do you have a testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus
Christ?
4. Do you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
day Saints as the prophet, seer, and revelator and as the only person
on the earth authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?
Do you sustain the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of
the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators?
Do you sustain the other General Authorities and local leaders of the
Church?
5. The Lord has said that all things are to be “done in cleanliness” before
Him (Doctrine and Covenants 42:41).
Do you strive for moral cleanliness in your thoughts and behavior?
Do you obey the law of chastity?
6. Do you follow the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ in your private
and public behavior with members of your family and others?
7. Do you support or promote any teachings, practices, or doctrine
contrary to those of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?
8. Do you strive to keep the Sabbath day holy, both at home and at
church; attend your meetings; prepare for and worthily partake of the
sacrament; and live your life in harmony with the laws and
commandments of the gospel?
9. Do you strive to be honest in all that you do?

10. Are you a full-tithe payer?
11. Do you understand and obey the Word of Wisdom?
12. Do you have any financial or other obligations to a former spouse
or to children?
If yes, are you current in meeting those obligations?
13. Do you keep the covenants that you made in the temple, including
wearing the temple garment as instructed in the endowment?
14. Are there serious sins in your life that need to be resolved with
priesthood authorities as part of your repentance?
15. Do you consider yourself worthy to enter the Lord’s house and
participate in temple ordinances?
Individual worthiness requires a total conversion of mind and heart to be more
like the Lord, to be an honest citizen, to be a better example, and to be a
holier person. I testify that such preparatory work brings innumerable
blessings in this life and inconceivable blessings for the life to come, including
the perpetuation of your family unit throughout all eternity “in a state of never-
ending happiness.”

## Spiritual Treasures – October 2019
And Satan certainly does not want you to understand that every time you
worthily serve and worship in the temple, you leave armed with God’s power
and with His angels having “charge over” you.
Your prayers, fasting, time in the scriptures, service in the temple, and family
history work will open the heavens to you.
As we have discussed here tonight, you sisters are vital to the work of the
temple, and the temple is where you will receive your highest spiritual
treasures.

## “Come, Follow Me” – April 2019
And we delight in knowing that many are receiving the power of God in their
lives as they worship and serve in the temple.

## Sisters’ Participation in the Gathering of Israel – October 2018
Third, establish a pattern of regular temple attendance. This may require a
little more sacrifice in your life. More regular time in the temple will allow the
Lord to teach you how to draw upon His priesthood power with which you
have been endowed in His temple.

## Becoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints – October 2018
Now let’s turn to the topic of temples. We know that our time in the temple is
crucial to our salvation and exaltation and to that of our families.
After we receive our own temple ordinances and make sacred covenants with
God, each one of us needs the ongoing spiritual strengthening and tutoring
that is possible only in the house of the Lord. And our ancestors need us to
serve as proxy for them.
My dear brothers and sisters, the assaults of the adversary are increasing
exponentially, in intensity and in variety. Our need to be in the temple on a
regular basis has never been greater. I plead with you to take a prayerful look
at how you spend your time. Invest time in your future and in that of your
family. If you have reasonable access to a temple, I urge you to find a way to
make an appointment regularly with the Lord—to be in His holy house—then
keep that appointment with exactness and joy. I promise you that the Lord will
bring the miracles He knows you need as you make sacrifices to serve and
worship in His temples.
Building and maintaining temples may not change your life, but spending your
time in the temple surely will. To those who have long been absent from the
temple, I encourage you to prepare and return as soon as possible. Then I
invite you to worship in the temple and pray to feel deeply the Savior’s infinite
love for you, that each of you may gain your own testimony that He directs this
sacred and ageless work.
